How many people? FOSDEM attracts more than 5000 attendees to the ULB Solbosch campus.
Many open source projects have stands at the event that are provided to them free of charge by the organizers. It is a perfect opportunity not only to collect some swag with the logo of your favorite project, but also to chat with its representatives and maybe even core developers and ask your questions in person.</description></item><item><title>preFOSDEM MySQL Days 2023</title><link>https://percona.community/events/prefosdem-2023/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/prefosdem-2023/</guid><description>Two days before the main FOSDEM event, MySQL enthusiasts all over the world gather together for learning and networking at preFOSDEM MySQL Days in Brussels.
