It takes place once a year in North America, Europe, and Asia. It is a perfect opportunity to learn from experts, meet friends, grow your network, and attend talks at a varied technical level and meetings focused on CNCF communities. This time I attended Kubecon in Amsterdam. The theme for this version of Kubecon was: community-in-bloom because we are still healing from COVID, and people are getting back to feeling comfortable participating in events.</description></item></channel></rss>
