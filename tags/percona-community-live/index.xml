Block device incidents are frequent and frightening in production. To achieve high availability, distributed databases usually have fault tolerant strategies to handle these incidents. As the system gets more complicated, it&amp;rsquo;s even hard to prove whether these strategies are working. For example, if the execution and distribution of scheduling commands also depend on the hanging storage, it will have no effect.</description></item><item><title>Flexible Indexing With Postgres</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-1-bruce-momjian/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-1-bruce-momjian/</guid><description> This session was presented on Percona Community Live Online June 21-23, 2022.

We live in a dangerous world and a catastrophe can happen at any time, including in our database. We can have a hardware failure, software failure, malicious software, or a human error and find ourselves with a data loss. While we work hard to prevent all those some are just not under our control and we cannot rely on luck, we need strategy and methods to be able to recover the maximum data we can in case a catastrophic event happens and this is what we will discuss during this talk.</description></item><item><title>Liquibase Data: Version Control and Collaboration for the Database</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-1-robert-reeves/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-1-robert-reeves/</guid><description>This session was presented on Percona Community Live Online June 21-23, 2022.

Right now we are in a spot where people think that the databases are just part of the commoditized infrastructure. But unfortunately, that leads us to a lot of problems. And Matt Yonkovit, The Head of Open Source Strategy at Percona, is talking about database design here. There are a lot of people out there who have never heard why they should focus on designing their databases, and their database infrastructure a little better.</description></item></channel></rss>
