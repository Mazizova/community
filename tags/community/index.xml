But the open source world is extensive and diverse, and everyone can find their place there. Your project will benefit from various experiences that non-coders can bring to the table. Isn’t that cool when you receive an issue with an interesting bug from the community, read about a user case in a blog or a review, or someone makes a video guide for your product?</description></item><item><title>Open Source for Non-Techs - Find Your Way to Contribute!</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2022/09/29/open-source-for-non-techs-find-your-way-to-contribute/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2022/09/29/open-source-for-non-techs-find-your-way-to-contribute/</guid><description>When we talk about open source contributing, we often associate it with only and exclusively code contributions made by engineers. But the open source world is extensive and diverse, and everyone can find their place there. Even if you don’t feel confident with coding, you can have a lot of things to keep you busy! What can it give back to you? Lots of stuff: sharping your professional skills and obtaining diversified experience, enriching your portfolio, connecting with open source community and passionate people, and last but not the least - definitely lots of fun.</description></item><item><title>Monthly Percona Developer Meetup</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2022/09/26/monthly-percona-developer-meetup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2022/09/26/monthly-percona-developer-meetup/</guid><description>What is this?
