But if I am writing it, I would like to test that what I wrote works. I often found myself copy-pasting something from documentation and trying to run it in the terminal (commands, files, etc.), and it didn&amp;rsquo;t work.
There are usually some environment, typos, or even wrong commands in the doc (that people copy-pasted from the wrong place).
I know that issue, and after writing the documentation, I usually try to clean up everything in my environment and test the doc.</description></item></channel></rss>
