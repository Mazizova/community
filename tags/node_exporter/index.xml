Usually, this comes from the fact that PMM or standalone people run node_exporter inside a container. PMM does it as a sidecar along with many other exporters to monitor DBs, and node_exporter comes out of the box as a default one. So people could see accurate data on dashboards, like Memory and CPU, that node_exporter reads inside the container.</description></item><item><title>Going back to the original node_exporter in PMM</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2021/10/21/going-back-to-original-pmm-node-exporter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2021/10/21/going-back-to-original-pmm-node-exporter/</guid><description>This is my first (I hope) post about something no so usual in our regular posts about technology.
Usually we discuss new features, talk about how to do something but even for me, a Percona developer, sometimes it is hard to know where and what to touch in PMM. There are many components, many abstractions, parts that send messages to remote APIs or agents, the PMM agent, the PMM API (pmm-managed), the command line client (pmm-admin) and all the external exporters.</description></item></channel></rss>
