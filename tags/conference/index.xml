This event was organized by a local university, Then when events started to happen online, during the pandemic, I was a speaker at about 41 events, where I presented 38 talks and 7 workshops (until September this year), in both Spanish and English.
Having the opportunity to join so many events and collaborate with communities around the world was one of the advantages that events were organized in virtual spaces.</description></item></channel></rss>
