How do you monitor them? There are a lot of servers with 100, 200… 500+ nodes. How can we collect, check, and analyze metrics from all these servers? How can we understand what and where something happened? Scroll, scroll, scroll&amp;hellip; down? That was the task that we faced at Percona and successfully resolved.
Issue With Home Dashboard Percona Monitoring and Management dashboards are based on Grafana.</description></item><item><title>How do We Keep Metrics for a Long Time in VictoriaMetrics</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-1-anton-bystrov/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-1-anton-bystrov/</guid><description> This session was presented on Percona Community Live Online June 21-23, 2022.

What is VictoriaMetrics? Why we choose it. Some data with compare VM and Prometheus. What is TSDB? How tuneup VM for preventing crash. What is deduplication, dawnsampling. How it works?

An important role is played by the time of their storage. Often, in order to understand certain processes and predict their development in the future, we need to analyze metrics over a fairly long period of time. In the case, when the project is just starting, their volume is relatively small, but over time it becomes larger and larger and there is a need for optimization.</description></item><item><title>How long do you keep the metrics in PMM?</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2022/02/11/poll-metrics-keep/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2022/02/11/poll-metrics-keep/</guid><description>Hello everyone! We are indeed excited to announce that the new release of VictoriaMetrics has many exciting features, one of them being downsampling.
Downsampling helps to reduce disk space usage and improves query performance in a big and long time series if applied independently per each time series. However, this feature works only with a large number of samples per series.
As we are keen on implementing downsampling in our future releases, we would like to understand how long you keep your metrics in PMM.</description></item></channel></rss>
