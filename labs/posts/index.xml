Previously I wrote about our Terraform provider to deploy Percona Server for MySQL — Percona Server for MySQL: Automatic Cloud Deployment with Terraform — and now we added capabilities to deploy PMM with Terraform.
You need the provider version 0.9.10 and PMM can be deployed as:</description></item><item><title>Percona Server for MySQL – Automatic Cloud Deployment with Terraform</title><link>https://percona.community/labs/posts/2022-10-20-terraform-percona-server-for-mysql/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/labs/posts/2022-10-20-terraform-percona-server-for-mysql/</guid><description>We are looking to provide simplified ways to deploy Percona software in cloud environments, especially for more advanced scenarios like replication and multi-node cluster (in the case of Percona XtraDB Cluster).
For this I propose trying out our new Terraform provider, with the capabilities:
Deploy in AWS or GCP Cloud. The provider will automatically create instances and deploy Percona Server for MySQL Deploy either Percona Server for MySQL or Percona XtraDB Cluster Choose instance size Choose storage volume size, type, and IOPs Multi-node async replication or multi-node Percona XtraDB Cluster Customize MySQL configuration file Capability to deploy MyRocks Engine To get more understanding let’s review some examples, but before that, where you can obtain modules:</description></item></channel></rss>
